# FIPS support

**NOTE: FIPS Support is in-progress**

The fleet-server can be built in FIPS mode.
This forces the use of a FIPS compliant provider to handle any cryptographic calls.

Currently FIPS is provided by compiling with the [microsoft/go](https://github.com/microsoft/go) distribution.
This toolchain must be present for local compilation.


## Build changes

As we are using Microsfot/go as a base we follow their conventions.

The buildtag `requirefips` is passed when FIPS is enabled/required.
Additionally when compiling `GOEXPERIMENT=systemcrypto` is specified.

The `FIPS=true` env var is used by our Makefile as the indicator that controls FIPS.
This env var is also passed to every child process the Makefile starts.
The following make commands have different behaviour when FIPS is enabled:

- `make multipass` - Provision a multipass VM with the Microsoft/go toolchain. See [Multipass VM Usage](#multipass-vm-usage) for additional details.
- `make local` - Compile a fleet-server targetting the machine's GOOS/GOARCH with FIPS enabled
- `make cover-*` - Compile a coverage and fips enabled fleet-server for e2e tests
- `make test-unit` - Run unit tests passing the `requirefips` build tag.
- `make benchmark` - Run benchmarks passing the `requirefips` build tag.
- `make release-*` - Compile a release binary with FIPS enabled. Will have the name fleet-server-$VERSION-$OS-$ARCH-fips
- `make package-target` - Will package a FIPS enabled release and produce the sha512 checksum for it.
- `make build-releaser` - Will create the fleet-server builder image based on Microsoft's FIPS enabled golang image.
- `make docker-release` - Runs `make release` to produce FIPS enabled binaries in a FIPS docker container.
- `make docker-cover-e2e-binaries` - Will produce coverage and FIPS enabled binaries for e2e tests from within the same docker container that `build-release` makes

### Multipass VM Usage

A Multipass VM created with `FIPS=true make multipass` is able to compile FIPS enabled golang programs, but is not able to run them.
When you try to run one the following error occurs:
```
GOFIPS=1 ./bin/fleet-server -c fleet-server.yml
panic: opensslcrypto: can't enable FIPS mode for OpenSSL 3.0.13 30 Jan 2024: openssl: FIPS mode not supported by any provider

goroutine 1 [running]:
crypto/internal/backend.init.1()
	/usr/local/go/src/crypto/internal/backend/openssl_linux.go:85 +0x210
```

In order to be  able to run a FIPS enabled binary, openssl must have a fips provider.
Openssl [provides instructions on how to do this](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/README-FIPS.md).

A TLDR for our multipass container is:

1. Download and compile the FIPS provider for openssl in the VM by running:
```
wget https://github.com/openssl/openssl/releases/download/openssl-3.0.13/openssl-3.0.13.tar.gz
tar -xzf openssl-3.0.13.tar.gz
cd openssl-3.0.13
./Configure enable-fips
make test
sudo make install_fips
sudo openssl fipsinstall -out /usr/local/ssl/fipsmodule.cnf -module /usr/local/lib/ossl-modules/fips.so
```

2. Copy the `fips.so` module to the system library, in order to find the location run:
```
openssl version -m
```

On my VM I would copy the `fips.so` module with:
```
sudo cp /usr/local/lib/ossl-modules/fips.so /usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/ossl-modules/fips.so
```

3. Create an openssl.cnf for the program to use with the contents:
```
config_diagnostics = 1
openssl_conf = openssl_init

.include /usr/local/ssl/fipsmodule.cnf

[openssl_init]
providers = provider_sect
alg_section = algorithm_sect

[provider_sect]
fips = fips_sect
base = base_sect

[base_sect]
activate = 1

[algorithm_sect]
default_properties = fips=yes
```

4. Run the program with the `OPENSSL_CONF=openssl.cnf` and `GOFIPS=1` env vars, i.e.,
```
OPENSSL_CONF=./openssl.cnf GOFIPS=1 ./bin/fleet-server -c fleet-server.yml
23:48:47.871 INF Boot fleet-server args=["-c","fleet-server.yml"] commit=55104f6f ecs.version=1.6.0 exe=./bin/fleet-server pid=65037 ppid=5642 service.name=fleet-server service.type=fleet-server version=9.0.0
i...
```

## Usage

A FIPS enabled binary should be ran with the env var `GOFIPS=1` set.
The system/image is required to have a FIPS compliant provider available.
