      summary: Keep the service running when Elasticsearch is not available
      description: |-
        Fleet Server will start when Elasticsearch is not reachable. During startup, if that's the case,
        the service will keep returning an "Starting" state.
        If the service loses connectivity with Elasticsearch after being healthy, it will go to a degraded
        state.
        For any non healthy state, the status endpoint responds with a 503 HTTP status code.

      description: |
        When fleet-server is running in agent mode output expecteced config will be checked for a "bootstrap" attribute.
        This should allow the elastic-agent to pass the policy output values under output.elasticsearch as expected, and
        also pass the values provided at enrollement, such as the service token under output.elasticsearch.bootstrap.
        This will allow fleet-server to use output settings from the policy, and have the enrollment configuration options
        as a fallback.
