  Add endpoint to serve PGP keys that clients can use when validating
  upgrades in cases where the embedded PGP key in a client is
  compromised and the client can't reach the Internet.
  Endpoint will serve a key on-disk if available, otherwise will attempt
  to retrieve from an upstream source.
  Endpoint will only serve TLS enabled requests and respond with a 501 to
  plain HTTP requests.
