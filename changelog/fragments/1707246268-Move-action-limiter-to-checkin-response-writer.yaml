  Remove the policy_limiter that was added by 3008 and not released.
  Move the action limiter to the checkin handler's write response method before a gzip.Writer is retrieved from the pool or allocated.
  This allows fleet-server to control gzip.Writer access for responses that contain either actions from the action dispatcher, or a
  POLICY_CHANGE action from the policy monitor.
  Removing the throttle/limiter from the policy monitor also greatly improves performance of policy dispatches.
