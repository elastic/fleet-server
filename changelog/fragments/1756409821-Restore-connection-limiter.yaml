  Restore connection level limiter to prevent OOM incidents.
  This limiter is used in addition to the request-level throttle so that once
  our in-flight requests reaches max_connections a 429 is returned, but if the
  total connections the server uses is over max_connections*1.1 the server drops
  the connection before the TLS handshake.
