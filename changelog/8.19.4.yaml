      summary: Restore connection limiter
      description: |
        Restore connection level limiter to prevent OOM incidents.
        This limiter is used in addition to the request-level throttle so that once
        our in-flight requests reaches max_connections a 429 is returned, but if the
        total connections the server uses is over max_connections*1.1 the server drops
        the connection before the TLS handshake.
