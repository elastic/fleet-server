      summary: Add agent_policy_id and policy_revision_idx to checkin requests
      description: |
        Add the agent_policy_id and policy_revision_idx attributes to checkin
        request bodies so an agent is able to inform fleet-server of its exact
        policy. These details will replace the need for an ack on
        policy_change actions, and will be used to determine when to send a
        policy change when there is a new revision available, or when the
        agent is reassigned to a different policy. Add a server setting under
        feature_flags.ignore_checkin_policy_id that disables this behavour and
        restores the previous approach.
