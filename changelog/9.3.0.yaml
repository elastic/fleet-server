      summary: Accept secret references in policies in either inline or path formats
      description: "Elastic Agent policies can contain secret references in one of two formats: inline or path.\nWith the inline format, the reference looks like this: `<path>: $co.elastic.secret{<secret ref>}`. \nWith the path format, the reference looks like this: `secrets.<path>.id:<secret ref>`.\nThis change ensures that Fleet Server accepts secret references in policies in either format.\n"
