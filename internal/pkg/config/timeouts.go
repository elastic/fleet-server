	// Note that for TLS, this include the TLS handshake as well.
	// In most cases, we are authenticating the apikey and doing an agent record lookup
	// *before* reading the body.  This is purposeful to avoid streaming data from an unauthenticated
	// connection. However, the downside is that if the roundtrip to Elastic is slow, we may
	// end up hitting the Read timeout before actually reading any data off the socket.
	// Use a large timeout to accommodate the authentication lag.  Add a ReadHeader timeout
	// below to handle preAuth.
