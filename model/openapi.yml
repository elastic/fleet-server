    The fleet-server API that is used by agents when enrolled with fleet.

    Note that the current implementations in the fleet-server and elastic-agent may have some difference specifically when it comes to some objects.

    The implementation of fleet-server by default also includes a connection count limiter, as well as limiters for request body sizes.
    If an agent attempts to make request but there are no remaining connections, the attempt will be blocked and the agent will get an error.
    If an agent tries to send a body that is too large the fleet-server will respond with a 400 status code.

        The agent checkin endpoint.
        Clients will long-poll this endpoint.
        A client may inform fleet-server of it's long-poll timeout in the request body.
        The fleet-server will return a response if there is a new action for the agent, or if the polling timeout is reached.
        The fleet-server may also use some jitter to offset the polling timeout, if specified a random amount of the jitter value may be subtracted from the polling timeout.
        The fleet-sever polling timeout is short-circuited in cases of heavy load where setting up the checkin (ensuring the API key is authed etc) takes longer then the timeout value.
        Fleet-server sets the poll timeout to 5m by default (with a 10m write timeout), for these values we assume that elastic-agent's request timeout is set to 10m and the cloud-proxy's timeout is longer than 10m.

        Annotate an agent with unenroll attributes so the UI will show it as uninstalled or orphaned instead of offline.
        API keys for an agent that is annotated will not be revoked by fleet-server.
        If an agent checks in after the unenroll attributes are set, the attributes will be removed from the agent document.
