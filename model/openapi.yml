    The fleet-server API that is used by agents when enrolled with fleet.

    Note that the current implementations in the fleet-server and elastic-agent may have some difference specifically when it comes to some objects.
    This is most notable when comparing the `Action` implementations. Fleet-server uses a general template for all actions and the elastic-agent will have more specific representations.

    The implementation of fleet-server by default also includes a connection count limiter, as well as limiters for request body sizes.
    If an agent attempts to make request but there are no remaining connections, the attempt will be blocked and the agent will get an error.
    If an agent tries to send a body that is too large the fleet-server will respond with a 400 status code.

        The elastic-agent will have additional details for what is expected when a specific action-type is recieved.
        Many attributes in this schema also contain yaml tags so the elastic-agent may serialize them.
        The structure of the `data` attribute will vary between action types.

        An additional consideration is Scheduled Actions. Scheduled actions are currently defined as actions that have non-empty values for both the `start_time` and `expiration` attributes.

        The fleet-server may also use some jitter to offset the polling duration, if a jitter value is defined the timeout value is the duration's max possible value.
        The fleet-sever polling timeout is short-circuited in cases of heavy load where setting up the checkin (ensuring the API key is authed etc) takes longer then the timeout value.
        The fleet-server sets the timeout to 28m.
