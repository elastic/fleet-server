# Fleet Server implementation

## Development

fleet-server is under development. The following are notes to help developers onboarding to the project to quickly get running. These notes might change at any time.

## Setup

To run and test fleet-server, a recent version of Elastic Agent and Kibana are needed. In the following Elastic Agent and Kibana are built from source. The fleet-server itself is not built from source but pulled from the latest snapshot build. It would be possible to also pull Elastic Agent or Kibana from the latest snapshot but the assumption that is made here that whoever is testing this, is likely developing either Elastic Agent or on the Kibana side.


### Kibana setup

The source code of Kibana must be checked out. After checkout, the following command must be run:

```
yarn kbn bootstrap
```

This will take a while the first time it is run. An error might be return in case not a valid node version is installed. Use nvm to install the correct version.

Now the following two commands must be run in parallel:

```
# Start ES
yarn es snapshot -E xpack.security.authc.api_key.enabled=true

# Start KB
yarn start --no-base-path
```

As soon as all is running, go to `http://localhost:5601`, enter `elastic/changeme` as credential and navigate to Fleet. Trigger the Fleet setup. As soon as this is completed, copy the `policy id` and `enrollment token` for the fleet-server policy. The policy id can be copied from the URL, the enrollment token can be found in the Enrollment Token list. 

NOTE: This step can be skipped if the full command below for the Elastic Agent is used.

Now Kibana is running and ready. The next step is to setup Elastic Agent.

## Beats repo

To build the Elastic Agent from source, check out the beats repository. Navigate to `x-pack/elastic-agent` and run the following command:

```
SNAPSHOT=true DEV=true PLATFORMS=darwin mage package
```

The above assumes you are running on OS X. Put the platform in you are running on. This speeds up packaging as it only builds it for your platform. As soon as this is completed (it might take a while for the first time) navigate to `build/distributions` and unpackage the `.tar.gz`. Change working directory to the elastic-agent directory and start the Elastic Agent:

```
KIBANA_HOST=http://localhost:5601 KIBANA_USERNAME=elastic KIBANA_PASSWORD=changeme ELASTICSEARCH_HOST=http://localhost:9200 ELASTICSEARCH_USERNAME=elastic ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD=changeme KIBANA_FLEET_SETUP=1 FLEET_SERVER_ENABLE=1 sudo ./elastic-agent container
```

This will start up Elastic Agent with fleet-server and directly enroll it. In addition Fleet is setup inside of Kibana.

## Running Elastic Agent with fleet-server in container

If you want to run Elastic Agent and fleet-server in a container but built Kibana from source, you have to add the following to your `config/kibana.dev.yml`:

```
server.host: 0.0.0.0
```

This makes sure, Kibana is accessible from the container. Start Kibana as before but for Elasticsearch, run the following command:

```
yarn es snapshot -E xpack.security.authc.api_key.enabled=true -E http.host=0.0.0.0
```

This makes sure also Elasticsearch is accessible to the container.

Start the Elastic Agent with the following command:

```
docker run -e KIBANA_HOST=http://{YOUR-IP}:5601 -e KIBANA_USERNAME=elastic -e KIBANA_PASSWORD=changeme -e ELASTICSEARCH_HOST=http://{YOUR-IP}:9200 -e ELASTICSEARCH_USERNAME=elastic -e ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD=changeme -e KIBANA_FLEET_SETUP=1 -e FLEET_SERVER_ENABLE=1 -e FLEET_SERVER_INSECURE_HTTP=1 docker.elastic.co/beats/elastic-agent:8.0.0-SNAPSHOT
```

Replace {YOUR-IP} with the IP address of your machine.

## fleet-server repo

By default the above will download the most recent snapshot build for fleet-server. To use your own development build, run `make release` in the fleet-server repository, go to `build/distributions` and copy the `.tar.gz` and `sha512` file to the `data/elastic-agent-{hash}/downloads` inside the elastic-agent directory. Now you run with your own build of fleet-server.
